# Fidelity Mod
_A Fabric mod for all horses, donkeys, and horses_

This mod adds a whip to the game, which can be used to take ownership of a tamed equine, and configure its behavior, as well as prevent animal theft.

Current available options are:
- Follow: the animal will follow you, similarly to how dogs, cats, and parrots follow their owner
- Standing: the animal will not move (it can still be pushed around though)
- Roaming: the animal will do what it normally does, i.e. roam around randomly
- Roaming free: this option revokes your ownership of the animal, allowing other players to mount it and use their whip on it
